mostly for Maciek's viewing pleasure, to kick things off with [live art studio](https://www.facebook.com/liveartstudio) and experiment with some graphics which might or might not lead to some future developments.

the composition is just a clone of http://rec-convo-the-edge.surge.sh/#pan1

code for this piece of work as well as links to credits in [README-rec-convo-the-edge.md](/git-hub/_projekt-kreatywa/live-art-360-convo/README-rec-convo-the-edge.md) 

with new graphics traced on the fly from sketches created on [lazy sunday afternoon](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=954242664626491&l=b9c13ac421) at Cable Studios in London.
